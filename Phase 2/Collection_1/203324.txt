Multichannel Investigation of Solar Modulation Effects
solar modulation measurements of CR leptons
solar wind
numerical model of CR modulation
AMS data
excellent multichannel CR monitor of solar activity
data of CR fluxes unaffected
scarcity of long-term CR data
varying solar activity conditions
effects of cosmic radiation
dependent effects
